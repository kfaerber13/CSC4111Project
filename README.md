## Installing and Using Gradle
Follow [the Gradle install guide](https://gradle.org/install/) to install the Gradle build tool and add it to your path.   
All build settings and dependencies will go in the `build.gradle` file at the directory level you want to configure for. 
For example, any global dependencies will go at the package root.   
To build the project, run `gradle build` in the IDE Terminal or with Command Prompt.
